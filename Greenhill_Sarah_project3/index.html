  	<p id="about">
  	<em>Valve</em> started with Half-Life®, the first-person, sci-fi shooter game that’s won more than 50 Game of the Year and a few "Best Game Ever" awards. They expanded the Half-Life franchise with a sequel and Half-Life 2 Episodes 1 and 2. Then, they added the horror titles Left 4 Dead® and Left 4 Dead 2, the multiplayer combat franchise Team Fortress®, the #1 online action game Counter-Strike® and the award-winning puzzlers Portal™ and Portal 2. And they’re just getting warmed up.
	<br>
	In addition to Steam, there is <strong>Source</strong>, <em>Valve's</em> own state-of-the-art game engine. Its sophisticated character animation, advanced <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, real-world physics, shader-based rendering, and super extensibility have helped them create some of the most popular and good-looking games on the market for computer and consoles. <em>Valve</em> doesn't like to brag, but Source is considered the most flexible, comprehensive, and powerful game development environment out there. And it’s about to get even better.

  	<blockquote>When you give smart talented people the freedom to create without fear of failure, amazing things happen. <em>Valve</em> sees it every day. In fact, some of their best insights have come from their biggest mistakes. And they're ok with that! Since 1996, this approach has produced award-winning games, leading-edge technologies, and a groundbreaking social entertainment platform. <em>Valve</em> is always looking for creative risk-takers who can keep that streak alive.</blockquote>

  	<p>
  	<strong>Steam</strong> is Valve's direct pipeline to customers. It began as a little sleeper project—a handy tool to update Counter-Strike—and morphed pretty quickly into the world's largest online gaming platform. <strong>Steam</strong> guarantees instant access to more than 1,800 game titles and connects its 35 million active users to each other—and to us. Through <strong>Steam</strong>, fans can easily buy, play, share, modify, and build communities around <em>Valve</em> products as well as titles from other independent game studios. <strong>Steam</strong> is available in 237 countries and 21 different languages.

  	<ul>
  		<li>Steam allows the user to have all (or most) of their games collected in one place.</li>
  		<li>The Steam client keeps track of the user's time spent playing, achievements, progress, and saves with ease.</li>
  		<li>All CD keys are stored and saved so that physical discs are a thing of the past and losing a game isn't an issue anymore.</li>
  		<li>The creation of Steam has created a whole new level of connectedness amongst gamers. The friend's list allows users to contact and chat with their friends, even while playing games.</li>
